2020-02-28,"A so-called reporter named @JohnJHarwood, who bombed so badly in the 2016 Presidential Debates that I thought he was going to be immediately fired (a Mini Mike type performance), is now with Fake News @CNN. A total loser!"

2020-02-28,"The Dems are working hard to take the prized nomination away from Bernie. Back room politics, which Bernie is not very good at. His people will not let it happen again!"
2020-02-28,"Mini Mike is getting slammed. His debates were, perhaps, the worst in presidential debating history. A total phony who disavowed Stop &amp; Frisk after swearing by it for years, and even recently. He horribly overused it, &amp; then dropped when running as a Dem. A total phony!"
2020-02-28,We strongly stand with Terrence! https://t.co/N4uFExD6Vz

2020-02-28,"To the people of South Carolina, Tom Steyer is a joke, laughed at by everyone, a total incompetent. He made money in coal, now he hates coal. Did you see him fawning over Crazy Bernie? Has no chance, a loser for South Carolina, doesnt deserve your vote!"

2020-03-01,"I would find it hard to believe that failed presidential candidates Tom Steyer, or Mini Mike Bloombeg, would contribute to the Democrat Party, even against me, after the way they have been treated - laughed at &amp; mocked. The real politicians ate them up and spit them out!"
2020-03-01,"Tom Steyer who, other than Mini Mike Bloomberg, spent more dollars for NOTHING than any candidate in history, quit the race today proclaiming how thrilled he was to be a part of the the Democrat Clown Show. Go away Tom and save whatever little money you have left!"
